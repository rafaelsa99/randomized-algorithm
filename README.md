# Randomized Algorithm
Practical Assignment of the Advanced Algorithms course of the Masters in Informatics Engineering of the University of Aveiro.

### Main Goal
Following the exhaustive search algorithm developed for the Maximum Independent Set Problem, the goal is to develop a probablistic approach to this problem.

### Steps:
Develop and test a probabilistic algorithm to solve the problem. <br>
Analyze the computational effort made by the developed algorithm. For this it must:
- Analyze the complexity of the algorithm.
- Perform a sequence of tests with successively larger instances of the problem. And register and analyze: (1) the execution time and (2) the number of solutions / configurations tested.
- Compare the results obtained in the two previous steps.
- Compare the performance of the exhaustive and probabilistic strategies.
- Produce a summarized report.
